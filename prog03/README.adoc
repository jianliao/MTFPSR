# Programming Assignment 03

:duetime: 11:59pm
:duedayA: Friday, February 4, 2022
:duedayB: Friday, February 11, 2022

In this programming assignment, you will implement a puzzle solver that is
parameterized by a puzzle trait and then use that trait and solver to solve
https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/one-player-games/jumpin[JumpIN'] and
https://www.thinkfun.com/products/invasion-of-the-cow-snatchers/[Invasion of the
Cow Snatchers] puzzles.  The goal is to gain experience working with `struct`-s
and `enum`-s, `trait`-s, and managing object ownership.

**Note:** This is a two part assignment.  Part A is due {duedayA} and is
comprised of activities in the `puzzle` and `jumpin` library crates; Part B is
due {duedayB} and is comprised of activities in the `iotcs` library crate.
After {duedayA}, a solution to Part A will be made available, which can be used
to complete Part B.

## Sources and Submission

We have setup a Git repository for each student on `git.cs.rit.edu`.  To _clone_
your repository, run either the command:

  git clone https://git.cs.rit.edu/psr2205/<ritid>psr.git

or, if you have setup SSH keys on `git.cs.rit.edu`, the command:

  git clone gitlab@git.cs.rit.edu:psr2205/<ritid>psr.git

If prompted for a password, then use your `__ritid__@cs.rit.edu` password.

Upon a successful clone, a directory called `__ritid__psr` will be created in
the current directory.  Over the course of the semester, programming assignments
will be stored as sub-directories within the `__ritid__psr` directory.

Next, _configure_ your local clone to _merge_ (and to not _rebase_) changes from
the _origin_ (a.k.a., upstream) repository on `git.cs.rit.edu`:

  git config pull.rebase false

Sources for Programming Assignment&nbsp;03 have been (or will shortly be)
committed to your repository in the `prog03` sub-directory.  If you cloned your
repository before the Programming Assignment&nbsp;03 sources have been
committed, then you will need to _pull_ the upstream changes into your local
clone, by running the command:

  git pull origin

from the `__ritid__psr` directory.  It is best to _pull_ with no uncommitted
changes in your local clone, but most commits made to the upstream repository
will only add a new top-level directory and there should be no merge conflicts.

We will tag programming assignments in the Git repositories at {duetime} on
{duedayA} and {duedayB}; make sure that you have _committed_ and _pushed_ your
final version before that time.  To do so, run the commands:

  git commit -a
  git push origin main

from the `__ritid__psr` directory.  If old programming assignment comments or
new programming assignment sources have been committed to your repository since
you last pulled, then you will receive an error message when trying to push:

  error: failed to push some refs to 'git.cs.rit.edu:psr2205/<ritid>psr.git'
  hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
  hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
  hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
  hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
  hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

To proceed, you will need to _pull_ the upstream changes into your local clone
and then _push_ your local changes upstream, by running the commands:

  git pull origin
  git push origin main

from the `__ritid__psr` directory.

## Organization

This project is organized as a workspace containing four crates:

* link:./puzzle[`puzzle`] (library crate): Defines the `Puzzle` trait and the `check` and `solve` functions
* link:./wgc-river[`wgc-river`] (binary crate): Solves the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem[Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage River Puzzle]; uses the `puzzle` crate
* link:./jumpin[`jumpin`] (library and binary crates): Solves https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/one-player-games/jumpin[JumpIN'] puzzles; uses the `puzzle` crate
* link:./iotcs[`iotcs`] (library and binary crates): Solves https://www.thinkfun.com/products/invasion-of-the-cow-snatchers/[Invasion of the Cow Snatchers] puzzles; uses the `puzzle` crate

## `puzzle` (library crate)

### `Puzzle` Trait

The `Puzzle` trait is an interface to a generic puzzle solver that will use
breadth-first search (BFS) with hashing of states.

[source,rust]
----
pub trait Puzzle {
    type Move;
    fn is_goal(&self) -> bool;
    fn next(&self) -> Vec<(Self::Move, Self)>;
}
----

A type that implements the `Puzzle` trait represents a puzzle state (i.e., a
particular configuration of elements of the puzzle).  The `Move` type represents
the moves that are specific to this puzzle.  The `is_goal` method determines
whether or not the puzzle state represents a solved puzzle.  The `next` method
enumerates all of the (legal) successor puzzle states of the current puzzle
state, along with the move that leads to that successor puzzle state.

### `check` function

The (provided) `check` function verifies that a sequence of moves solves a puzzle.

[source,rust]
----
pub fn check<P>(p0: P, ms: &[P::Move]) -> Option<P>
where
    P: Puzzle,
    P::Move: Eq,
----

Returns `Some(p)`, if `p` is the goal puzzle state reached from `p0` by the
moves `ms`.

Returns `None`, if either the sequence of moves `ms` starting from `p0` is not
legal or if the puzzle state reached from `p0` by the moves `ms` is not a goal
state.

### `solve` function

**Complete the `solve` function.** (Part A activity)

The `solve` function solves a puzzle using BFS with hashing of states.

[source,rust]
----
pub fn solve<P>(p0: P) -> Option<(Vec<P::Move>, P)>
where
    P: Puzzle + Eq + Hash + Clone,
    P::Move: Clone,
----

The `solve` function returns `+Some((ms,p))+` if puzzle `p0` can be solved by
the sequence of moves `ms` to a goal state `p`.  The sequence of moves `ms`
should be one of the shortest sequence of moves from `p0` to a goal state; that
is, for any sequence of moves `ns` from `p0` to a goal state,
`+ms.len() <= ns.len()+`.  Note that there may not be a unique goal state for a
puzzle; therefore, the goal state `p` reached by the sequence of moves `ms` is
returned.

Returns `None` if `p0` cannot be solved by any sequence of moves.

A BFS is used to find the shortest sequence of moves from `p0` to a goal state.
A hash set or hash table is used to avoid redundant puzzle states (e.g.,
different sequences of moves may lead to the same puzzle state).

The generic type parameter `P` must implement `Puzzle` (because it represents a
puzzle state), `Eq` and `Hash` (in order to for puzzle states to serve as
hash-set or hash-table keys), and `Clone` (in order for puzzle states to be
placed in both the hash set or hash table and the BFS queue).

Pseudo-code for a simplifed `solve` function (which only returns a boolean
indicating whether or not the puzzle is solvable) is as follows:

[source]
----
function solve(p0) {
  visited = new HashSet();
  todo = new Queue();
  visited.insert(p0);
  todo.enqueue(p0);
  while ! todo.is_empty() {
    p = todo.dequeue();
    if p.is_goal() {
      return true;
    }
    for (m,q) in p.next() {
      if ! (visited.contains(q)) {
        visited.insert(q);
        todo.enqueue(q);
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}
----

Relative to the above pseudo-code, the `puzzle::solve` function must be able to
determine the (minimal) sequence of moves that leads to each state.  Also, in
Rust, ownership of puzzle states and moves must be properly handled.

#### Discussion/Hints

The Rust standard library provides both
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html[`std::collections::HashSet`]
and
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html[`std::collections::HashMap`].
The former suffices if one only needs to represent a set of puzzle states, but
for some implementations of `solve`, one may want to associate some information
with each puzzle state, in which case the latter is recommended.  Recall that it
is more efficient to use the
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html#method.entry[`entry`]
method of
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html[`std::collections::HashMap`]
than to use a
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html#method.get[`get`]
followed by
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html#method.insert[`insert`].

Note that it is required that the keys of a
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html[`std::collections::HashSet`]
or
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html[`std::collections::HashMap`]
implement the https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Eq.html[`std::cmp::Eq`]
and https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hash/trait.Hash.html[`std::hash::Hash`]
traits, although this can frequently be achieved by using
`+#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]+`.

The Rust standard library provides
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html[`std::collections::VecDeque`],
which can be used as both a queue and a deque (double-ended queue).

#### Challenges

The following are neither submission requirements nor extra credit work.  They
are simply opportunities to challenge your understanding of and skills with
Rust.

The `solve` function assumes that the generic type parameter `P` implements
`Puzzle` (because it represents a puzzle state), `Eq` and `Hash` (in order to
for puzzle states to serve as hash-set or hash-table keys), and `Clone` (in
order for puzzle states to be placed in both the hash set or hash table and the
BFS queue).  The `Clone` trait bound, however, is unfortunate, especially if
puzzle states are "large" and expensive to copy.  (Of course, if puzzle states
are "large" and expensive to copy, then it is probably prohibitive to keep track
of all puzzle states that have been visited.)  Can the `Clone` trait bound be
eliminated, while maintaining an efficient solver?  Some thoughts:

* One could only place puzzle states in the hash table, mapping each puzzle
  state to an index number and then place the index number into the BFS queue.
  However, one would require a linear search of the hash table to map from an
  index number to the puzzle state when popping an index number from the BFS
  queue.

* Instead of using a hash set or hash table to track the puzzle states that have
  been visited, one could use a simple `Vec`, which implicitly maps each puzzle
  state to an index and then place the index number into the BFS queue.
  However, one require a linear search of the `Vec` to determine whether or not
  a newly generated puzzle state had already been visited.

* Instead of placing puzzle states into both the hash set or hash table and the
  BFS queue, it would be nice to only place _references_ to puzzle states into
  the hash set or hash table and the BFS queue.  However, this requires moving
  puzzle states into some data structure with a lifetime that lives throughout
  the execution of the `solve` function.  Moreover, it must be possible to move
  the final goal puzzle state out of the data structure in order to be returned
  as a component of the result.

Later in the course, we will see some mechanisms by which the `Clone` trait
bound can be eliminated (for example, using a reference-counting pointer).

For simplicity, the `solve` function assumes that the `P::Move` type (i.e., the
type of puzzle moves) implements `Clone`.  However, there is an implementation
of `solve` that does not require this trait bound (at the expense of performing
additional copies of puzzle states).

## `wgc-river` (binary crate)

The `wgc-river` binary crate uses the `puzzle` library crate to solve the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem[Wolf, Goat, and
Cabbage River Puzzle].  This program serves as a simple test of the `puzzle`
library crate.

### Example

----
$ cargo -q run --bin wgc-river
solution:
cross to west bank with goat
cross to east bank with nothing
cross to west bank with wolf
cross to east bank with goat
cross to west bank with cabbage
cross to east bank with nothing
cross to west bank with goat
----

It is possible (though unlikely) that a correct implementation of
`puzzle::solve` could return a different 7 move solution (where the moves of the
`wolf` and the `cabbage` are swapped).

## `jumpin` (library and binary crates)

The `jumpin` library and binary crates uses the `puzzle` library crate to solve
https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/one-player-games/jumpin[JumpIN'] puzzles.  The
essence of the puzzles is to help rabbits jump around a forest to the safety of
their holes.  Watch the https://youtu.be/8sEoYzcmOfc[video], play it
https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/try-smartgames-online/one-player-games/jumpin[online],
and read the game rules at the bottom of the
https://www.smartgamesandpuzzles.com/jump-in.html[designer's commentary] to
understand the rules of the puzzle.

An extensive test suite is provided in the link:./jumpin/src/tests.rs[`tests`
module], which can be run with `cargo test`.

### Input Format

https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/one-player-games/jumpin[JumpIN'] puzzles are
provided in a simple text format.  A valid input will always consist of exactly
5 lines of 6 characters each (5 printable characters and a single newline
character).  The 25 non-newline characters to the 25 grid locations that may
contain a hole, a rabbit, a mushroom, or a fox.

Objects are represented by single characters:

* `H`: hole
* `W`: white rabbit
* `B`: brown rabbit
* `G`: grey rabbit
* `M`: mushroom
* `F`: first fox head
* `X`: first fox tail
* `V`: second fox head ("fox" in Dutch is "vos")
* `S`: second fox tail

For example, the input text format for the Junior 20 challenge shown in the
https://youtu.be/8sEoYzcmOfc[video] is as follows:

----
HX GH
 F M 
  H B
   SV
HWM H
----

Note that some challenges place a rabbit or mushroom in a hole, in which case
only the `W`, `B`, `G`, or `M` character appears in that position.

### Implementation Overview

We model https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/one-player-games/jumpin[JumpIN'] puzzles
using four main types (`enum Object`, `struct Pos`, `struct JumpIN`, and
`enum Direction`).

#### `Object` type

The `Object` type represents objects that may be placed (and moved) on the
gameboard.

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum Object {
    WhiteRabbit,
    BrownRabbit,
    GreyRabbit,
    Mushroom,
    Fox1Head,
    Fox1Tail,
    Fox2Head,
    Fox2Tail,
}
----

Note that there is no `Hole` variant, as the holes are always at fixed positions
on the gameboard.

#### `Pos` type

The `Pos` type represents a position on the gameboard.  The North-West corner of
the gameboard is `Pos {x: 0, y: 0}`, the North-East corner of the gameboard
`Pos {x: 4, y: 0}`, the South-West corner of the gameboard is
`Pos {x: 0, y: 4}`, and the South-East corner of the gameboard is
`Pos {x: 4, y: 4}`.

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash)]
struct Pos {
    x: usize,
    y: usize,
}
----

The (private) `pos` module ensures that the `Pos` type can only be created via
the `new` associated function and accessed via the `x`, `y`, and `xy` methods.

#### `Direction` type

The `Direction` type represents the cardinal directions, in which objects may be
moved on the gameboard.

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum Direction { North, South, West, East, }
----

#### `JumpIN` type

The `JumpIN` type represents a
https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/one-player-games/jumpin[JumpIN'] puzzle state: a
gameboard with placed objects.

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct JumpIN([[Option<Object>; 5]; 5]);
----

The (private) `jumpin` module ensures that the `JumpIN` type can only be created
via the `new` associated function and accessed via the `get` and `get_mut`
methods.

#### `Puzzle` implementation for `JumpIN` type

The `JumpIN` type implements the `Puzzle` trait by providing
implementations of the `is_goal` and `next` methods.

[source, rust]
----
impl Puzzle for JumpIN {
    type Move = (Object,Direction);

    fn is_goal(&self) -> bool { ... }
    fn next(&self) -> Vec<(Self::Move, Self)> { ... }
}
----

The (provided) `is_goal` method determines whether or not the puzzle state
represents a solved puzzle.  For
https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/one-player-games/jumpin[JumpIN'] puzzles, this
means that all rabbits are in holes.

The (provided) `next` method enumerates all of the (legal) successor puzzle
states of the current puzzle state, along with the move that leads to that
successor puzzle state.  For
https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/one-player-games/jumpin[JumpIN'] puzzles, this
means that a rabbit jumps over at least one obstacle and into the first empty
space, no rabbit moves off the side of the forest, that no fox moves into
another object or off the side of the forest.  The `next` method works by
iterating over all positions and all directions; for each position and
direction, it tries to move a rabbit at that position in that direction and
tries to move a fox at that position in that direction.

#### ``JumpIN``'s `move_rabbit` and `move_fox` methods

**Complete the `move_rabbit` and `move_fox` methods for `JumpIN`.** (Part A activity)

`gb.move_rabbit(pos, dir`) attempts to move a rabbit at position `pos` in the
direction `dir`; if successful, return the rabbit object that was moved and the
new gameboard (`JumpIN` puzzle state).  This method implements the game rules
with respect to rabbits.  Check that there is a rabbit at position `pos`, that
the next position in the direction `dir` is an obstacle (a rabbit must jump over
at least one obstacle), and find the position `posd` (destination) of the first
empty space in the direction `dir`.  If so, then it should copy the current
gameboard into a new gameboard, update `pos` in the new gameboard to `None` and
update `posd` in the new gameboard to `Some`.

`gb.move_fox(pos, dir`) attempts to move a fox at position `pos` in the
direction `dir`; if successful, return the fox head object that was moved and
the new gameboard (`JumpIN` puzzle state).  This method implements the game
rules with respect to foxes.  Let `posb` (backward) be the previous position in
direction `dir` and let `posf` (forward) be the next position in direction
`dir`.  Check that there are matching fox components at positions `posb` and
`pos` and that `posf` is an empty space.  If so, then it should copy the current
gameboard into a new gameboard, update `posf` in the new gameboard to `Some` of
the object at `pos` in the current gameboard, update `pos` in the new gameboard
to `Some` of the object at `posb` in the current gameboard, and update `posd` in
the new gameboard to `None`.  Note that the object returned by the `move_fox`
method should be a fox head object, which is not necessarily the object that is
at position `pos` in the current gameboard.

#### `main` function

The (provided) `main` function combines the above into a complete program.  It
checks that there is a single command-line argument.  That command-line argument
is interpreted as a file name, which is read into a string.  The string is
printed out (to facilitate manually checking a solution against the input).
That string is parsed into a `JumpIN` value.  That `JumpIN` value is passed to
`puzzle::solve` to be solved.  If no solution is found, then `no solution` is
printed.  If a solution is found, then the sequence of moves is printed on a
single line.

## `iotcs` (library and binary crates)

The `iotcs` library and binary crates uses the `puzzle` library crate to solve
https://www.thinkfun.com/products/invasion-of-the-cow-snatchers/[Invasion of the
Cow Snatchers] puzzles.  The essence of the puzzles is to move a UFO around a
farm, beaming up cattle and avoiding obstacles.  Watch the
https://youtu.be/OndefZTAYV8[video] and read the
https://www.thinkfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Invas-1021-Instructions.pdf[instructions
(pdf)] to understand the rules of the puzzle.  Our implementation will only
handle the easy to super-hard levels (and will not handle the genius levels with
crop circles).  Also, we will consider a puzzle to be solved when all cattle
have been beamed up (with the Red Bull picked up last) and the UFO has moved to
a side of the farm; that is, a final move off of a side of the farm is not
required (or allowed).

An extensive test suite is provided in the link:./iotcs/src/tests.rs[`tests`
module], which can be run with `cargo test`.

### Input Format

https://www.thinkfun.com/products/invasion-of-the-cow-snatchers/[Invasion of the
Cow Snatchers] puzzles are provided in a simple text format.  The basic template
is as follows:

----
 | | | 
-+-+-+-
 | | | 
-+-+-+-
 | | | 
-+-+-+-
 | | | 
----

The space characters correspond to the 16 grid locations that may contain a cow
or the bull, the silo, or the UFO.  The `|` and `-` characters correspond to the
24 boundaries between grid locations that may contain a wall.  The `+`
characters correspond to the 9 corners between grid locations (which will never
contain any object).  A valid input will always consist of exactly 7 lines of 8
characters each (7 printable characters and a single newline character).

Objects are represented by single characters that replace either a space, `|`,
or `-` character in the above template:

* `U`: UFO
* `A`: azure (blue) cow
* `Y`: yellow cow
* `P`: purple cow
* `O`: orange cow
* `R`: red bull
* `B`: barn (red wall)
* `C`: crop row (green wall)
* `H`: hay bale (yellow wall)
* `F`: fences (white wall)
* `S`: silo

For example, the input text format for the Easy 00 challenge card on page 6 of the
https://www.thinkfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Invas-1021-Instructions.pdf[instructions] is as follows:

----
A| CPB

### Implementation Overview

You will model
https://www.thinkfun.com/products/invasion-of-the-cow-snatchers/[Invasion of the
Cow Snatchers] puzzles using three main types (`struct Farm`, `struct
IotCS<'a>`, and `enum Direction`) that are defined, but incomplete, in the
initial sources.  In addition, you will want to define additional types to
represent other elements, such as cattle, walls, the silo, the UFO, and grid
positions.

#### `Farm` type

**Add fields to complete the implementation of the `Farm` type and complete the
`from_str` associated function for ``Farm``'s implementation of the `FromStr`
trait.** (Part B activity)

The `Farm` type will represent the initial and fixed elements of an
https://www.thinkfun.com/products/invasion-of-the-cow-snatchers/[Invasion of the
Cow Snatchers] puzzle: the initial positions of the UFO and the cattle and the
fixed positions of the walls and the silo.  The `Farm` type will implement the
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/trait.FromStr.html[`FromStr` trait] to parse a
`Farm` value from a string, according to the input format described above.
(Note that ``FromStr``'s
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/trait.FromStr.html#tymethod.from_str[`from_str`]
method is often used implicitly, through
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html[`str`]'s
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.parse[`parse`] method.)
Upon a successful parse, ``Farm``'s `from_str` method will return
`Ok(Farm {...})`.  On any parse error (e.g., too few characters, too many
characters, unrecognized character, unexpected template or object character,
missing red bull, duplicate cattle, missing or duplicate ufo, duplicate silo),
``Farm``'s `from_str` associated function will return `Err(FarmParseError)`.
(In a more robust implementation, the `FarmParseError` type would carry
additional information about the nature of the parse error.)

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub struct Farm { ... }

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct FarmParseError;
impl FromStr for Farm {
    type Err = FarmParseError;
    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> { ... }
}
----

#### `Direction` type

The `Direction` type represents the cardinal directions, in which the UFO may be
moved.

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum Direction { North, South, West, East, }
impl Display for Direction { ... /* provided */ ...}
----

#### `IotCS` type

**Add fields to complete the implementation of the `IotCS` type, complete
the `new` associated function, and complete the `ufo_with_cattle_to_string`
method.** (Part B activity)

The `IotCS` type will represent an
https://www.thinkfun.com/products/invasion-of-the-cow-snatchers/[Invasion of the
Cow Snatchers] puzzle state: a _reference_ to a `Farm` value (providing
information about the initial positions of the cattle and the fixed positions of
the walls and the silo) and the current status of the UFO (position and
collection of beamed-up cattle).  Because the `IotCS` type will implement
`Clone`, it is important that the `IotCS` type contain a _reference_ to a `Farm`
value rather than an owned `Farm` value; the former is simply a pointer that
implements `Copy` and may therefore be efficiently cloned, while the latter
would require a deep copy to be cloned.

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub struct IotCS<'a> {farm: &'a Farm, ...}
impl<'a> IotCS<'a> {
    pub fn new(farm: &'a Farm) -> Self { ... }
    pub fn ufo_with_cattle_to_string(&self) -> String { ... }
}
----

The `new` associated function of the `IotCS` type takes a `Farm` reference and
returns a `IotCS` value that represents the initial puzzle state.

The `ufo_with_cattle_to_string` method returns a string representation of the
UFO and the cattle stack order.  The result `String` should begin with `U:` and
proceed with the characters for the cattle in the order in which they were
beamed up.  For example, the `ufo_with_cattle_to_string` method on an `IotCS`
value representing a goal state for the Easy 00 challenge card on page 6 of the
https://www.thinkfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Invas-1021-Instructions.pdf[instructions]
should return `U:PAYOR` (i.e., the purple cow beamed-up first, then the azure
(blue) cow, then the yellow cow, then the orange cow, and lastly the red bull).

#### `Puzzle` implementation for `IotCS` type

**Complete the `is_goal` and `next` methods for ``IotCS``'s implementation of
the `Puzzle` trait.** (Part B activity)

The `IotCS` type implements the `Puzzle` trait by providing implementations of
the `is_goal` and `next` methods.

[source, rust]
----
impl<'a> Puzzle for IotCS<'a> {
    type Move = Direction;

    fn is_goal(&self) -> bool { ... }
    fn next(&self) -> Vec<(Self::Move, Self)> { ... }
}
----

The `is_goal` method determines whether or not the puzzle state represents a
solved puzzle.  For
https://www.thinkfun.com/products/invasion-of-the-cow-snatchers/[Invasion of the
Cow Snatchers] puzzles, this means that all cattle from the farm have been
beamed up (with the red bull picked up last) and the UFO has moved to a side of
the farm.

The `next` method enumerates all of the (legal) successor puzzle states of the
current puzzle state, along with the move that leads to that successor puzzle
state.  For
https://www.thinkfun.com/products/invasion-of-the-cow-snatchers/[Invasion of the
Cow Snatchers] puzzles, this means that the UFO does not move off of a side of
the farm, that the UFO does not move over the silo, that the UFO does not move
over a wall with too many cattle, that the UFO does not pick up the red bull
before all other cattle have been beamed up.

#### `main` function

The (provided) `main` function combines the above into a complete program.  It
checks that there is a single command-line argument.  That command-line argument
is interpreted as a file name, which is read into a string.  That string is
parsed into a `Farm` value.  The string is also printed out (to facilitate
manually checking a solution against the input).  An initial `IotCS` value is
constructed from a reference to the parsed `Farm` value.  That `IotCS` value is
passed to `puzzle::solve` to be solved.  If no solution is found, then `no
solution` is printed.  If a solution is found, then the sequence of moves is
printed on a single line followed by the result of the
`ufo_with_cattle_to_string` method on the goal state.

### Discussion/Hints

You can, and should, define additional types to represent other elements of
https://www.thinkfun.com/products/invasion-of-the-cow-snatchers/[Invasion of the
Cow Snatchers] puzzles, such as cattle, walls, the silo, the UFO, and grid
positions.

Be sure that your additions to the `IotCS` type does not duplicate information
that is present in the `Farm` reference.  In particular, the positions of the
walls and the silo should always be fetched from the `Farm` reference, and never
copied into a field of the `IotCS` type.

Think about how to best represent walls and their positions.  A 4x4 grid
suffices to represent the positions that may contain a cow or the bull, the
silo, or the UFO.  However, walls are placed in between adjacent positions of
the 4x4 grid.

Note that there may be multiple sequences of moves that solve an
https://www.thinkfun.com/products/invasion-of-the-cow-snatchers/[Invasion of the
Cow Snatchers] puzzle.  However, all sequences of moves that solve a puzzle will
result in the same cattle stack order (as returned by
`ufo_with_cattle_to_string`).
